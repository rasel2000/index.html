    I am a Teacher, a not for profit organization, founded by Harvard University Alumni aims to build an alternate and a practice based model for teacher education in India. This model has the potential to transform and reinvent teacher education in the country and thus reform school education. We are offering a Post Graduate Diploma in Learning and Teaching. 

    PGDLT is an innovative, practice-based one-year full time programme, commencing in June 2015. It offers a unique synthesis of theory and practice, combining a year long classroom engagement in select schools with a carefully aligned sequence of coursework. Aspiring teachers are intensively mentored and guided through the year by a clinical teacher educator, who is present on the field. This process helps participants draw meaningful connections between their classroom work and the latest in education theory and research.

    “I am a business man,” the shoemaker abruptly said to conceal his embarrassment, “so I will explain you right away why I talk to you. I have a girl, my daughter Miriam—she is nineteen—a very nice girl and also so pretty that everybody looks on her when she passes by in the street. She is smart, always with a book, and I thought to myself that a boy like you, an educated boy—I thought maybe you will be interested sometime to meet a girl like this.” He laughed a bit when he had finished and was tempted to say more but had the good sense not to. How does this passage from “The First Seven Years” by Bernard Malamud contribute to the story’s main idea?

                        Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred
                        to as CSS, is a simply designed language
                        intended to simplify the process of
                        making web pages presentable. CSS allows
                        you to apply styles to web pages.

                        Javascript was developed by Brendan
                        Eich in 1995. At first, it was called
                        LiveScript but was later name to
                        JavaScript. JavaScript is the muscle
